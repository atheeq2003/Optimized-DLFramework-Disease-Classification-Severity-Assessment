## üåü Key Features

- **Multi-Class Lung Disease Diagnosis**: Classifies CXR images into **COVID-19, Tuberculosis, Viral Pneumonia, and Normal** cases.
- **Severity Assessment**: Evaluates disease severity as **Mild, Moderate, or Severe** using an Optimized Extreme Learning Machine (O-ELM).
- **Interactive Web UI**: Built with Streamlit for easy deployment and user interaction.
- **Hybrid Feature Fusion**: Combines **deep features (EfficientNetV2-L)** with **handcrafted features (GLCM, HOG, Wavelet)** for robust performance.
- **Optimized Training**: Enhanced with **Parrot Optimizer (PO)** and **Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA)** for efficient model convergence.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves **90.58% classification accuracy** and **80.67% severity assessment accuracy**.

## üõ†Ô∏è System Architecture

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalization, resizing, and lung segmentation using **MultiRes U-Net**.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Deep features from **EfficientNetV2-L** + handcrafted features (GLCM, HOG).
3. **Feature Fusion**: Combines features for a unified representation.
4. **Classification**: **Softmax classifier** for disease prediction.
5. **Severity Assessment**: **O-ELM** for grading disease severity.
